Description:

	This application is a simple side scrolling platform game written in C++ 
	using the SDL library.  The user controls the main character, an undead 
	archer, to shoot arrows at enemies and race their way through the level 
	using the platforms.  The score is recorded when the user crosses the 
	finish line.  This application serves as an exercise in software development 
	of highly interactive, event driven applications.  
	
Technology:

	The application is written in C++ using the SDL API. 
	
Controls:

	The user controls the character by using the D key to move forward, the A key 
	to move backward, and the space bar to jump. The player can also shoot his bow
	by clicking and holding the left mouse button until the character releases the
	arrow.
